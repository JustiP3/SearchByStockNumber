"#SearchByStockNumber" 

This program searches for a user defined stock number in a user defined text file.
My initial goal when creating this project was to make a program with a GUI that does something meaningful.
Now that I have it working, I want to:
1. Make my code more modular and readable
2. Format my GUI to look nice.
