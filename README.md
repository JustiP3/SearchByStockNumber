"#SearchByStockNumber" 

I am still figuring out how to use github.
I followed a tutorial to upload my project here, but for some reason my java files were not uploaded sucessfully on the first try, only the files in the workspace/ folder were uploaded.
I uploaded the actual java source code after an hour of struggling, but the file structure here on github is not what it should be.

Intened file structure:
workspace/
  -.settings
        -org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs
  -bin
        -application
          searchbystock$1.class
          searchbystock$2.class
          searchbystock.class
  -src
        -application
          searchbystock.java
  .classpath
  .project
  build.fxbuild
